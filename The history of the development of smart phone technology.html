        <h1>In 1926, during an interview with the American magazine Collier “Founded in 1888,” the legendary scientist Nikola Tesla described a piece of technology that one day would revolutionize, and what he said in this interview:
            “When wireless technology is fully developed, we will be able to communicate with each other directly regardless of the distance, not only this, but through television and telephones we will be able to see and hear each other as if we are talking together face to face Even if the distance between us is thousands of miles, and the device that we will use to do these things will be surprising compared to our phones today, and a day will come and any person can carry the phone in his pocket.

Since Tesla did not give the name of the smartphone to this device, its expectations are enforced !! As the phone industry went through stages, and gradually developed, and competition occurred between companies over the years until the phones reached their current form and became part of our lives, we depend on them for everything.</h1>
